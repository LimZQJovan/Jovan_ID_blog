          <li>Introduction to five common HTML tags: headings, paragraphs, image, ordered lists, and unordered lists.</li>
          <li>A recipe for Hainanese Chicken Rice was created and written in HTML code.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The code included headings to separate the ingredients, instructions, and conclusion of the recipe.</li>
            <li>An ordered list was used to list the steps for making the Hainanese Chicken Rice.</li>
            <li>An unordered list was used to list the ingredients required for the recipe.</li>

        <h2>Week 2 Progress</h2>
        <p>This week, I accomplished the following tasks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Completed CA1 semantic exercise</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Overall, the goal is to structure the HTML content in a logical and organized manner, making it easier to maintain and update.</li>
            <li>By using the header, footer, section, and nav elements, the content is grouped into meaningful sections, making it easier to understand and work with.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Completed CA2 semantic exercise vr</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Overall, the goal is to make the HTML more meaningful and organized, using semantic markup to accurately describe the content and improve the accessibility and search engine optimization of the recipe blog.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The existing external CSS file "style.css" is used to add style to the HTML content</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To add the CSS file, the link method is used to link the HTML file to the CSS file.</li>
            <li>This allows for the styling information to be stored separately from the HTML content, making it easier to maintain and update.</li>
            <li>A few CSS properties are added to the HTML content to enhance its appearance.</li>
            <li>These properties may include color, background-color, font-family, and text-align.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The #heading ID is applied to an appropriate element.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>By using the ID, the styles can be applied to a specific element on the page.</li>
            <li>A class style is also applied to other appropriate elements, in order to change their appearance as well.</li>
            <li>Classes allow for styles to be reused multiple times throughout the page, giving more control over the appearance of different elements.</li>
            <li>Overall, the goal is to use the CSS styles to improve the appearance and make it more visually appealing to the user</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The process of adding Google fonts to the website by visiting fonts.google.com</li>
          <ul>
            <li>On the website, the desired font(s) are selected by browsing through the available options and making a selection.</li>
            <li>At least two Google fonts are chosen, one for headings and another for paragraphs, and the stylesheet is used to implement the selected fonts</li>
            <li>The CSS stylesheet is updated to include the code necessary to apply the selected fonts to the appropriate elements, such as headings and paragraphs.</li>
            <li>Overall, the goal is to add Google fonts to the recipe blog in order to enhance its appearance and create a more personalized typography style for the website.</li>
          </ul>
